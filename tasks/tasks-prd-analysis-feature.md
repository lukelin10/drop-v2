### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `Analysis.tsx` and `Analysis.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- Integration tests should be run in a separate test database environment to avoid affecting development data.
- Database migrations should be run in order and tested in a development environment before production deployment.
- E2E tests require a full application setup and should be run against a staging environment.
- **UI Consistency**: All new components must reuse existing design tokens, components, and patterns from the app. Reference the existing Analysis.tsx page for layout structure, card styling, and color schemes.
- **Component Reuse**: Before creating new UI components, check if existing components can be extended or reused (Button, Card, Loading, Icons, Typography classes).
- **Design System**: Follow the app's established design system including spacing utilities (p-4, mb-3), color classes (primary, secondary, muted-foreground), and icon patterns (ri-* classes).

## Future Improvements

- **Database Relations Deep Testing**: Create comprehensive database relationship tests with proper TypeScript configuration and dependency management. The current core functionality is covered by workflow and API tests, but additional edge cases and performance testing would be valuable.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Add dedicated performance tests for large-scale analysis operations.
- **Concurrency Testing**: Implement stress tests for concurrent analysis creation and database operations.
